Title: BarKeeps Helper
My project fetches cocktail recipes to keep as a reference for cocktail parties. It also spotlights a random drink.

All data was aquired via The CocktailDB API. https://thecocktaildb.com/

data is automatically fetch on the load up to the page. a random drink is rendered above the search bar.
in the search bar one can write the name of a drink or type of drink and will fetch all the drinks containing the input in name. then renders the list below. each drink img had a listener so that the ingrediants and imstructions pop up below the image.
